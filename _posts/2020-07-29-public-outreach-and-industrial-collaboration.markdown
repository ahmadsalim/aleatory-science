### Meetup
The Aleatory Science team is one of the organizers of the [Pioneers of the Probabilistic Programming](https://www.meetup.com/Pioneers-of-Probabilistic-Programming/) meetup group. The group had presentations on probabilistic programming and Bayesian reasoning from both academic researchers and industrial practitioners, including companies like Paperflow, Hypefactors, Facebook, Nordea, and Hugin.

### Student Projects with Industrial Collaboration
We offer a number of collaboration opportunities with industrial partners for student projects at BSc and MSc levels. For companies, it provides an opportunity to apply the latest probabilistic programming technology for experimental tasks that they would normally not have time to do. For students, it provides an opportunity to apply their skills for practical problems and a path to interesting future job opportunities.

Currently, we have partnerships with companies like [Paperflow](https://paperflow.com), [Relion](https://relion.dk) and [Hypefactors](https://hypefactors.com). See the [project descriptions here](https://github.com/aleatory-science/deep-probprog-course/tree/master#part-ii---deep-probabilistic-programming-project).
